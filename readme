#Title: Human Intention Recognition Using Context Relationships in Complex Scenes.

This is for the human intention recognition using context relationships in complex scenes.
We proposed a Spatial Temporal Graph Attention Informer Neural Network.
The code is executed on dual RTX2080ti for both training and testing.
